#  AI-Driven Wine Quality Prediction (Indian Wines)

This project focuses on predicting the quality of Indian wines using advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. It was developed as part of the Samsung AI training program, using a real-world dataset of approximately 60,000 wine samples.




##  Problem Statement

Wine quality is influenced by various chemical and physical properties. This project aims to predict the wine quality score (typically rated 0â€“10) using a dataset of Indian wines, enabling better quality control and recommendations for manufacturers and consumers.



##  Features Used

Some of the key features considered for prediction:

- Alcohol
- pH
- Sulphates
- Citric Acid
- Density
- Fixed Acidity
- Chlorides
- Volatile Acidity
- Total Sulfur Dioxide





##  Dataset


- Size: ~60,000 samples
- Format: CSV
